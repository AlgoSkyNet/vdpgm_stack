  <description brief="vdpgm stack">
    The vdpgm stack provides a ROS inteface to the matlab code written by
    Kenichi Kurihara for Variational Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Models.
    The contained packages should be migrated to catkin, but since rosjava
    still lives in the world of rosmake, we're sticking with the old regime
    for now.
